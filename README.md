# Game Project - Soothing Tic Tac Toe

This application allows the user to unwind by playing a game of tic tac toe where they always win, because they're always playing themselves. It enables the user to create an account, sign in, start a new game, play the game and know which player won (or if a tie), see how many times they've unwound with the app, change their password, and sign out.

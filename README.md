# Game Project - Soothing Tic Tac Toe

This application allows the user to unwind by playing a game of tic tac toe where they always win, because they're always playing themselves. It enables the user to create an account, sign in, start a new game, play the game and know which player won (or if a tie), see how many times they've unwound with the app, change their password, and sign out.

- As a user, I want to be able to create a new game so I can play it

- As a user, I want to only be able to select empty spots on the gameboard so no one can cheat
- As a user, I want to know when the game is over and who won the game so I can brag
- As a user, once the game is over I don't want to be able to place any new markers so I have to start a new game

### Unsolved Problems

- I'd like to eventually freshen up the UI to make for a cleaner experience that is more on-brand with the login page.
- I'd like to eventually make the app more mobile friendly
- I'd like to eventually add a feature that enables the user to continue playing unfinished games.
